I work as a consultant for my own company <a href="http://www.graph-technologies.com/">Graph Technologies</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.csc.kth.se/~roelof/">PhD student in Deep Learning</a> at <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH Institute of Technology</a> in Stockholm, Sweden.

Other things I enjoy doing:

* Running the <a href="www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Deep-Learning-Meetup/">Stockholm Deep Learning Meetup</a>. If you find yourself in Stockholm, drop by!
* Keeping <a href="http://gitxiv.com/">GitXiv</a> running, a portal for Collaborative Open Computer Science I started together with <a href="https://twitter.com/samim">Samim Winniger</a>
* Rambling about (again together with <a href="https://twitter.com/samim">@samim</a>) on <a href="http://ethicalmachines.com/">Ethical Machines</a>, a recently started podcast about Humans, Machines & Ethics

## What this blog is about:

* startup-related things
* notes on my ongoing PhD research
* open-science / reproducible research
